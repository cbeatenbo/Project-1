    <h2>Special Occasion Cakes</h2>
    </div>
    <p id="p2">Special occasions are those that include milestone birthdays, anniversaries, bridal
        showers, baby showers, and celebrations of any kind. When considering what special 
        occasion cake to order, it is important to know the type of party as well as the 
        theme of the occasion. All the same considerations for ordering a birthday cake are in order,
        except special occasion cakes require more attention to the details of the event. 
        <p> Below are some images of special occasion cakes that were custom
            designed.
